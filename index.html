      <h2>League Overview</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          The Suggins Select Fantasy Football league began with humble origins as a 6-man competition between friends from suburban Glen Ellyn, IL in 2020. At the time, no one could have predicted its rapid success and growth into the organization it is today. Across four years, the league's size has doubled, new rules have been instituted, and champions (as well as losers) have been created. This page is dedicated to chronicling the rich history of a storied fantasy football league as well as providing updates on the current state of play. Weekly updates with commentary, activity, and standings can be found here.

      <h2>Where We Stand Today</h2>

        <p>
          Following week 8, Suggins Select is at an interesting crossroads. On one end of the spectrum, "johnny's Supreme Team" continues to dominate currently at a 7-1 record, while on the bottom end "2024 Kneecap Tour" sits at a paltry 1-7 to date. Between these two extremes, there exists a tight race across eight teams who share records between 3-5 and 5-3, including four teams stuck at 0.500 on the season. Below is the current standings:
