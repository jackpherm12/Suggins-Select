    <h1>Power Rankings</h1>
      <p>
        Now this is the fun part - where does everyone stack up going forward? Below is my outlook for each team as it stands today:

       <h3> 1. Di**er Down</h3>
         <h4> Last Rank: 2 </h4>
           Di**er Down moves up to the top spot following a couple important wins. From top to bottom, this team looks ready to contend for another championship. 
        <h3> 2. johnny's Supreme Team</h3>
         <h4> Last Week Rank: 1 </h4>
         JST moves down one spot to the second overall position. This is a tough squad, but some inconsistency in the RB2 and WR2 positions puts them below Di**er Down. Regardless, this team looks set for playoff push. 
      <h3> 3. Boats and YoungHoes II</h3>
         <h4> Last Week Rank: 5 </h4>
         Two weeks ago I said this team might need to move up in the rankings, and now it make that move. BAYHII is one of the most complete teams in the league, and could be a championship contender as long as Calvin Ridley stays consistent and he can fill the Kareem Hunt gap once Pacheco returns.
      <h3> 4. The Cobras</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: 3 </h4>
        The Cobras continue to be a top 4 team in my opinion especially with the return of TJ Hockenson. Despite the 5-5 record, this squad should breeze into the playoffs and could be tough to beat once they get there considering Pacheco is coming back. 
      <h3> 5. King Quan</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: 4 </h4>
         King Quan continues to be a solid team with a superstar RB core and Cooper Kupp leading the wide receiver room. Courtland Sutton and Cedric Tillman seem like weak spots on the surface, but if they continue their recent performances then King Quan could conquer the league.
      <h3> 6. McCaffree Willy</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: 9 </h4>
         What did I say last time? This team had a big asterisk by its ranking due to the uncertainty with McCaffrey and it looks like that uncertainty has cleared up. Now this team has an RB room including CMC/Chase Brown/James Conner, a WR room including Terry Mclaurin/Davante Adams/Marvin Harrison Jr/Mooney, and Kyler is starting to heat up. McCaffree Willy started off slow but this could be the darkest horse competition.
      <h3> 7. Robinson Rock Pound</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: 6</h4>
        Bijan is turning into the top three pick we all expected, Mark Andrews is like his vintage form, and Nico Collins as well as Brian Robinson are returning from injuries. Jared Goff and DJ Moore look like they might be going the wrong direction after the last few games. The true toss-ups on this team are Jauan Jennings and Jaylen Waddle who could carry the flex spot through season end or be to volatile to rely on. RRP looks set up for a playoff berth, but it remains to be seen if they can do much more.
      <h3> 8. CTEspn</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: 7 </h4>
        CTEspn is another team with big question marks. If Jamarr Chase could reliably put up 50+ points a game then we could move them up quite a few spots. Alas, that was only the third game in his career with a similar 250+ yards and 3 TDs. Besides Chase, Kyren, Kraft and DK the rest of the team feels shaky. Purdy, Swift, and Jakobi Meyers are all high risk high reward starts each week. CTEspn should have a playoff spot, but I wouldnt expect much more from them.
      <h3> 9. 2024 Kneecap Tour</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: 11 </h4>
        If we could start the season from scratch today, 2024 Kneecap Tour would be much higher than they are today, but a 3-7 record is tough to overcome. That being said, a 2 game win streak puts them on the doorstep of a playoff appearance. A couple more wins and they could put themselves in contention to compete for a championship two years in a row, while anymore losses might send them to the toilet bowl.
      <h3> 10. Feelin a lil Mahomie</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: 12 </h4>
        This is a similar framework to how I view 2024 Kneecap Tour. On paper, this team should be better, but here we are at 3-7 with only a couple weeks to prove themselves. Feelin a lil Mahomie needs some things to fall in their favor to have a shot at the playoffs.
      <h3> 11. Saquanma Balls</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: 10 </h4>
        Saquanma Balls is a bad team. To give you an idea just how bad they are, Tyler Conklin is starting in the flex for them. Josh Allen and JT are both good players, but the rest of this team is hard to look at. Jaylen Warren and Khalil Shakir are both borderline flex players in starting roles at WR2 and RB2. Saquanma Balls needs some players to step up in a big way.
      <h3> 12. Angel Reese 1.01 2025</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: 8 </h4>
        While Saquanma balls is bad, AR 1.01 2025 is plain terrible. After two straight losses to the lowest ranked squads, this team sits outside playoff contention, and for good reason. Breece Hall, Kyle Pitts and the QBs continue to underperform, Brian Thomas has been battling injuries, and Ricky Pearsall is currently W2. With a matchup against Saquanma Balls looming this week, this team has the potential to lose three consecutive games to the three losingest squads. Welcome to back-to-back toilet bowls.
