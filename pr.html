    <h1>Power Rankings</h1>
      <p>
        Now this is the fun part - where does everyone stack up going forward? Below is my outlook for each team as it stands today:

        <h3> 1. johnny's Supreme Team</h3>
         <h4> Last Week Rank: N/A </h4>
           Not much to say here. Led by the QB1, the TE1, and a breakout season by Malik Nabers, this squad looks to be in pole position for a championship. Tua coming back should also bump up Tyreek's production in the final stretch.
        <h3> 2. Di**er Down</h3>
         <h4> Last Week Rank: N/A </h4>
         Anchored by two top tier RBs in Jahmyr Gibbs an Alvin Kamara, double D has positioned itself as the #2 team to beat. Although Travis Kelce started the season slow, he looks set to dominate the remainder of the year. The big question for this team is the health of its receiving core.
      <h3> 3. The Cobras</h3>
         <h4> Last Week Rank: N/A </h4>
         This is the first hot take, but The Cobras are the third best team in the league right now. Despite a mediocre record to show thus far, this unit has a deadly lineup including Justin Jettas, James Cook, Kenneth Walker, and JK Dobbins. Not to mention Hock, Tank Dell, and Pacheco expected to play bigger roles down the stretch. The big potential blind spot is QB where Bo Nix, while inconsistent, has shown elite rushing upside. Nix already has four rushing TDs to his name this year. The Cobras might be the darkhorse team to beat this year.
      <h3> 4. King Quan</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: N/A </h4>
        King Quan comes in at the four spot following the return of Cooper Kupp as well as the dynamic duo of Josh Jacobs and Saquon Barkley. Cade Otton's ascent in rest of year rankings following the loss of Mike Evans and Chris Godwin to injury, also gives this team a bump. Questions remain especially in the WR2 and flex spots (Courtland Sutton and Mattison aren't my favorite options). Will Baker continue to cook despite losing his favorite weapons? Will Diggs stay on the King Quan IR (he's out for the season)? This is a solid team, but anymore injuries could cast this ranking into doubt.
      <h3> 5. Boats and YoungHoes II</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: N/A </h4>
         Originally, when I did these rankings, I had BAYH II ranked lower than this. After re-examining, they had to be moved up. Jalen Hurts, Derrick Henry, Joe Mixon, Amon Ra, and Brock Bowers could be the highest scoring players of their respective positions any given week. Not to mention, in the short-run Kareem Hunt will continue to be a solid flex option until Pacheco comes back. The medium to long-term questions will be who fills the flex and WR2 gaps once Kareem Hunt is out of the picture? Even with these questions lingering, this team has a lot of potential.
      <h3> 6. Robinson Rock Pound</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: N/A </h4>
         RRP has a solid core of RBs with both B Robinsons, a good QB in Jordan Love, and potentially high upside in DJ Moore as well as Waddle. Where this unit falls behind the others listed above is lack of depth. As of now, this team is set to start two TEs week 9 (Andrews and Ertz). Although both players are solid enough for the TE position, neither has the upside to compete with high scoring WRs and RBs. The unfortunate thing is: these are probably the best options on the roster. When Juauan Jennings and Trey Sermon fill out your depth chart, you have to get creative.
      <h3> 7. CTEspn</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: N/A</h4>
        CTEspn kicks off the back half of these rankings, although this team in many ways has a lot of promise. Starting off with RBs, Kyren Williams and Swift continue to be strong anchors averaging a combined 35 points a game between the two of them. Funny enough, if you look at the next two slots at WR, Chase and DK are averaging a very similar 35 points per game. Despite a solid foundation across the core four, the rest of the team leaves a lot to be seen. Purdy has been pedestrian this year, but he might see a boost with the return of CMC. Laporta might return to form as the playoffs draw nearer. Diontae Johnson might be able to perform better in the high powered Ravens offense. All this to say, a lot is left to be seen for this crew through the end of the year.
      <h3> 8. Angel Reese 1.01 2025</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: N/A </h4>
        Rounding out the final playoff spot is AR 1.01 2025. When healthy, Breece Hall, Drake London, and Brian Thomas are the heart and soul of this team with each averaging 15.5+ PPG. Kyle Pitts has stepped into a more pronounced role in the last few weeks, and has the potential to finish as a top TE this year. Everything else about this team is meh at best. RB2s of Javonte Williams, Zack Moss, and Tyrone Tracy - meh. CJ Stroud and Sam Darnold as QBs - meh. Wandale Robinson in the backup flex spot - meh. It's one thing if your top guys can carry the load, but this might be too much to bare for them.
      <h3> 9. McCaffree Willy</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: N/A </h4>
        This ranking starts with an asterisk. If CMC comes back next week, this team should rise up the board pretty quickly. But given how secretive his recovery process has been, I'm not holding my breath. Assuming CMC takes a couple more weeks to get up and running, 9th seems like a fair spot for this team. Across the depth chart, this squad is teeming with mediocrity. Terry Mclaurin is the only non-QB averaging 15+ points this year (exactly 15.0 PPG). McBride has been one of the best TEs this year, but that's not saying much with the dropoff at the position. James Conner, MHJ, Adams, McConkey, Mooney, even McLaurin are all fine starters but not league winners.
      <h3> 10. Saquanma Balls</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: N/A </h4>
        Let's start with the good: Olave, JT, Evan Engram, and Devonta Smith are all healthy. Josh Allen is still doing Josh Allen things (besides throwing INTs) albeit at a slower rate than we're used to. Now the not so good: Olave, Engram, and Smith have shown their ceilings are capped somewhat by poor QB play, which limits the upside of this team at crucial positions. Finally the bad: there are no good solutions for the holes at RB2 and the flex. RBs on this team include Tyjae Spears, Jaylen Warren, Zeke, and Zamir White. None of which average more than 7.4 PPG. With capped performance from WRs and a revolving door of bad RB2s, it's hard to picture this team as a contender.
      <h3> 11. Kneecap Tour 2025</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: N/A </h4>
        With AJ Brown and Puka back in the lineup for KT 2025, I would love to say the skies are clearing after a horrendous start to the season, but I can't say for certain yet. It's undeniable Jayden Daniels has been that guy this year, and Achane, Brown, and Puka should step back into leaders of this team after injuries, but the rest of the team lacks clarity. Rico Dowdle and Najee Harris split time in the RB2 position with neither averaging more than 12.9 PPG. Not bad, but not good either. The real concern comes from the pair of Bills in the middle of the rotation with Cooper and Kincaid both consistently scoring less than 10 PPG to date. Of course, Amari is still being worked into this offense, but if things don't turn around soon for Kneecap Tour 2025, the bottom can be a lonely place.
      <h3> 12. Asher's Awesome Team</h3>
        <h4> Last Week Rank: N/A </h4>
        Finally, we finish things off with Asher's Awesome Team, which has struggled for most of the season. CeeDee Lamb looks like he could be stepping back into form and Aaron Jones doesn't look like he's lost a step when he stays healthy while Pollard has been solid as an RB2. The rest of this team has a lot to prove. Njoku should be better with Jameis Winston under center, but that's not a given. Rachaad White has been placed in a three man RB committee. Mike Evans won't be back for a couple weeks, which puts pressure on Keenan Allen to produce as WR2 until then. Worst of all, the QB situation between Mahomes and Herbert has been horrible this year with neither guy averaging more than 14.4 PPG. This team needs to turn things around quickly, or they could find themselves in the toilet bowl.
