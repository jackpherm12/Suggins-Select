    <h3 class="matchup">#6 McCaffree Willy vs #8 Saquanma Balls</h3>
    It all comes down to this. #6 seed McCaffree Willy versus #8 seed Saquanma Balls faceoff head to head for all the glory. Only a few short weeks ago, both teams were on the bubble to make the playoffs at all. MCW has been without his #1 overall pick, while Saquanma has relied on an experimental AI bot to make coaching decisions. Despite hard-fought adversity, both teams square off in the ultimate championship. </p>
    <p> As it stands, MCW has the edge according to Vegas by a projected 15 points (down from 20+ at the beginning of the week). Despite expert confidence, four players on MCW are listed questionable including his QB, RB1, and both WRs, which opens the door for the odds to flip. The McCaffree Willys need to hope for some of those players to suit up this weekend, otherwise this game could be tight. If they can stay healthy, the matchups are pretty favorable. The Cardinals should put up points against the Rams, while Scary Terry and Davante play against defenses that have let receivers score. A Rich should have a high ceiling against a pourous Giants defense. </p>
    <p> Saquanma Balls once again seems down and out, but then again that's been the story of their entire season. They barely secured the final slot in the playoffs and since then have upset every team in their way. Could this week be a reversion to reality, or one more miracle pushing them to glory? Honestly it could go either way. Everything on paper is going against them: a couple injuries, a lack of depth, a poor matchup for their star QB, not to mention Tanner McKee might be throwing Devonta Smith the ball (I don't even know who that is), but everything on paper said this team wouldn't come close to a championship. </p>
    <p>Final projection is McCaffree Willy takes home the prize, but at a slimmer margin than even these teams expect.
      <h4>Winner Projection: McCaffree Willy </h4>
