    <h3 class="matchup">#1 johnny's Supreme Team vs #8 Saquanma Balls</h3>
    The first seed versus the last seeded playoff team seems like a good place to start. Following a below average yet still solid 10 point game from Kittle, the outcome here seems pretty obvious. I think JSS wins this in a blowout with lineups the way they are right now. Saquanma is starting Evan Engram as of this writing who recently got placed on IR. Without a starting tight-end I don't see an upset happening, but if they can grab someone off waivers I think this is a closer game than the experts project.

    <h3 class="matchup">#2 King Quan vs #7 CTESpn</h3>
    Before Thursday, I would have been much more excited for the 2 seed King Quan. After a Kupp 0 berger, this is a pretty even ball game. Both teams have players capable of dropping 40 points and other players waiting to drop more duds. With Purdy putting up an almost equally abysmal 4 points on TNF for CTEspn, give me King Quan in a close one.
      <h4>Winner Projection: King Quan </h4>
      <h4>Suggins Line: King Quan -1.5 </h4>
    <h3 class="matchup">#3 Boats and YoungHoes II vs #6 McCaffree Willy</h3>
    My big upset in the first round will come from #6 McCaffree Willy over #3 Boats and YoungHoes II. This one comes down to matchups and MCW has the advantage. The Cardinals account for three players on the MCW squad and their easy matchup against the Pats should allow Conner, McBride, and Murray to have a field day. Adams and McLaurin should feast against Jacksonville/New Orleans as well which is why I give McCaffree Willy a small edge.
      <h4>Winner Projection: McCaffree Willy </h4>
      <h4>Suggins Line: McCaffree Willy -5.5 </h4>
    <h3 class="matchup">#4 Di**er Down vs #5 Robinson rock pound</h3>
     Another close one, and what I think will be the highest scoring game of the week, but the edge might come down to a 5 point showing from Jauan Jennings. To beat a team with Burrow, Gibbs, Kamara, Wilson, Higgins, and Hubbard (all 6 averaging 15+ PPG) you need to be on your A++ game. That being said, there's still hope when you have both B Robinsons, Nico Collins, and DJ Moore. Altogether, I'll pick Di**er Down in a shootout.
      <h4>Winner Projection: Di**er Down </h4>
      <h4>Suggins Line: Di**er Down -9.5 </h4>
